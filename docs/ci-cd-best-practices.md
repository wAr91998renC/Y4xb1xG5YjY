# CI/CD Pipelines for Microservices Deployment

In this document, we outline the CI/CD pipelines designed for efficient, reliable, and automated deployment of microservices. The setup leverages modern DevOps tools and practices to ensure smooth integration and delivery workflows.

---

## **üèóÔ∏è Build, Test, and Publish Pipeline**

This pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and publishing application artifacts.

### **Pipeline Steps:**

1. **Source Checkout:**
   - Fetch the latest code from the repository.

2. **Build:**
   - Compile the application code.
   - Restore dependencies.
   - Ensure build configurations are optimized for deployment.

3. **Run Tests:**
   - Execute all **Unit Tests** to validate business logic.
   - Optional: Run **Integration Tests** against mock services.

4. **Publish Artifact:**
   - Package the application into deployable artifacts (e.g., Docker images, `.zip` files).
   - Push the artifacts to a remote artifact repository (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Artifacts, or GitHub Packages).

5. **Notify:**
   - Send notifications (via email, Slack, or other tools) for build success or failure.

## **üöÄ Deploy Services Pipeline**

This pipeline is responsible for deploying all microservices to the staging or production environments using Terraform.

### **Pipeline Steps:**

1. **Check for New Artifacts:**
   - Query the artifact repository for the latest build.
   - Skip deployment if no new artifacts are available.

2. **Terraform Initialization:**
   - Initialize the Terraform environment.
   - Retrieve the remote state to ensure consistency.

3. **Apply Terraform Plan:**
   - Compare the desired state with the current infrastructure.
   - Deploy changes if required or leave the environment as is.

4. **Service Deployment:**
   - Deploy the microservices artifacts to the Kubernetes cluster or virtual machines.
   - Ensure all common services (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ, SQL Server) are properly configured.

5. **Run Post-Deployment Tests (Optional):**
   - Verify the deployment with smoke tests or health checks.

6. **Notify:**
   - Send notifications for successful or failed deployments.

## **üîë Key Features of the Pipelines**

- **Artifact Versioning:** Each build produces a versioned artifact, enabling rollbacks if needed.
- **Environment Consistency:** Terraform ensures that the infrastructure matches the defined state.
- **Incremental Deployments:** Deployments occur only when a new artifact is detected, reducing unnecessary changes.
- **Automation & Monitoring:** Both pipelines are fully automated and integrated with monitoring tools for visibility.

### **Build Pipeline Example**
# build-pipeline.yml
name: Build and Test Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Setup .NET
      uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3
      with:
        dotnet-version: '7.0.x'

    - name: Restore dependencies
      run: dotnet restore

    - name: Build application
      run: dotnet build --no-restore --configuration Release

    - name: Run Unit Tests
      run: dotnet test --no-build --verbosity normal --configuration Release

    - name: Publish artifacts
      run: |
        dotnet publish -c Release -o ./publish
        zip -r artifact.zip ./publish
    - name: Upload artifact
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: application-artifact
        path: artifact.zip

### **Deploy Pipeline Example**
# deploy-pipeline.yml
name: Deploy Services Pipeline

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Download artifact
      uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: application-artifact

    - name: Setup Terraform
      uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2
      with:
        terraform_version: 1.5.0

    - name: Terraform Init
      run: terraform init

    - name: Terraform Plan
      run: terraform plan -out=tfplan

    - name: Terraform Apply
      run: terraform apply -input=false tfplan

    - name: Deploy Services
      run: |
        kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
        kubectl rollout status deployment my-microservice

    - name: Post-Deployment Tests
      run: curl -f http://my-microservice/health || exit 1


### **Terraform Deployment Example**
# main.tf
provider "kubernetes" {
  config_path = "~/.kube/config"
}

provider "helm" {
  kubernetes {
    config_path = "~/.kube/config"
  }
}

resource "helm_release" "my_microservice" {
  name       = "my-microservice"
  chart      = "my-microservice-chart"
  namespace  = "default"
  version    = "1.0.0"

  set {
    name  = "image.tag"
    value = var.image_tag
  }
}

resource "kubernetes_deployment" "my_microservice" {
  metadata {
    name      = "my-microservice"
    namespace = "default"
  }

  spec {
    replicas = 3

    selector {
      match_labels = {
        app = "my-microservice"
      }
    }

    template {
      metadata {
        labels = {
          app = "my-microservice"
        }
      }

      spec {
        container {
          image = "my-microservice:${var.image_tag}"
          name  = "my-microservice"

          ports {
            container_port = 8080
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
